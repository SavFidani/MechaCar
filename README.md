## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Significant Variables
In order to analyze the impacts of our variables, we were looking to format a regression of the following form:

mpg = ⍺ + βvehicle_length + βvehicle_weight + βspoiler_angle + βground_clearance + βAWD + 𝓊

where...
⍺ = our y-intercept
β = our independent variable coefficients 
𝓊 = the error term

Upon an initial analysis of the relationship between our variables we discover the following coefficients:
